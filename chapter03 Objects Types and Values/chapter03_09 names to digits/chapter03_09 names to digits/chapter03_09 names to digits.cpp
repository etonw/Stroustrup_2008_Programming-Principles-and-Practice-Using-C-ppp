/* chapter03_09 names to digits.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

9. Write a program that converts spelled-out numbers such as "zero" and
"two" into digits, such as 0 and 2. When the user inputs a number, the
program should print out the corresponding digit. Do it for the values 0,
1 , 2, 3, and 4 and write out "not a number I know" if the user enters
something that doesn't correspond, such as "stupid computer!"

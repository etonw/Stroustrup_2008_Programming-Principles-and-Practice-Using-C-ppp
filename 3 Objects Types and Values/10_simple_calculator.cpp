/*  
EXERCISE 10. SIMPLE CALCULATOR

10 Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:

+ 100 3.14
* 4 5

Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double. Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
